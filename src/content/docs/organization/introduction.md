We are an official nonprofit organization focused on providing educational services, including workshops and mentoring, to grade-school students in the Monmouth County area.

## Nonprofit status

We are not yet a 501(c)(3), and we do not have our own EIN. Thanks to our fiscal sponsorship by the [Hack Foundation](https://the.hackfoundation.org/) (EIN: 81-2908499), however, we are exempt from taxes and receive many of the same benefits as an independent 501(c)(3). The Hack Foundation serves as the legal entity for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), the organization that provides us with banking, legal, and other services.
